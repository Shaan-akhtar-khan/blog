        <h2> HELLO! </h2>
        <p id="para1">I know this site could have been better in terms of styling ,linking of pages, functionality etc. but this is
            just
            an application of concepts that i have learnt so far in my web dev journey and i will not stop until i
            can make websites that rival or even surpass the websites of tech companies in every term and every concept
            there is
            in WEB DEV.
            But i need an opportunity at a reputed company like yours in order to gain the best practices and experiemce
            that your skillful
            employees have and which helps them in making such great websites. which is why i need your help to get a
            shot at your company</p>

        <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU HIRE ME?</h2>
        <p> Unlike others i won`t brag about "time management" or "teamwork" here as those words have lost their value
            due to
            thier use by every other unskilled programmer.Instead i want to show it to you that i have more than what it
            takes to be
            at your company and be among the best programmers in the near future.All i ask is an opportunity to prove
            myself.

        <h2>SKILLS </h2>
        <p id="khiladi">
            extreme profieciency in C++ , DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS ( PROBLEM SOLVING ) , BOOTSTRAP 5 , HTML CSS AND 
            JAVASCRIPT. 
           <p> Surely, there will be technologies that i should have learnt recently but the amount of hardwork and prodcutivity that i have aattained over the years can allow
            me to learn anything in a very short span of time . And in the presence of experts in this field i can do it even faster and 
            better.

            <p> 
                I love coding which is why will love my job in this field which means that i can extract more workhours from a day
                than most others and that too with extreme productivity .
                I hope that you will invite me to your team soon.
